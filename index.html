                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Joel Garcia-Cervantes. I'm a computer science student at Portland State
                        University, on track to complete my bachelor's and begin my master's in the same field. I come
                        from a Hispanic background and I'm a first-generation college student from an immigrant family.
                        My academic and professional interests lie at the intersection of software engineering and
                        artificial intelligence, where I'm actively exploring how to integrate tools like LangChain,
                        LlamaIndex, and neural networks into real-world applications. I'm especially passionate about
                        learning what AI is capable of to build solutions that solve
                        meaningful problems and improve lives. Currently, I'm developing my skills as a full-stack
                        developer — building dynamic, user-friendly interfaces with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I
                        also plan to expand into backend technologies.</p><br>
                    <p>Outside the classroom, I serve as president of
                        PSU's SHPE chapter, where I lead initiatives to support Hispanic and underrepresented students
                        in STEM. Together with my chapter we have been able to create a STEM community for
                        underrepresented groups on campus! On my free time I also enjoy helping lower dvision students
                        tackle difficult concepts and solidify my own knowledge about them. Some of my other hobbies
                        include futbol, the gym, and finding good food spots.</p><br>

                                    time, I'm expanding into backend technologies to become a well-rounded full-stack
                                    developer capable of building complete, end-to-end applications. This foundation is
                                    essential for my goal of integrating AI into real-world software—allowing me to
                                    handle everything from the user interface to the server-side logic needed to support
                                    intelligent features.</p>

                                <p class="skill-details">I take a hands on approach to learn applied AI tools like
                                    YOLOv8 for computer vision, and LangChain and LlamaIndex for building intelligent
                                    agents that reason over data and interact with users. I'm focused on integrating
                                    these frameworks into real-world applications that
                                    mirror how modern AI systems operate. Whether it’s experimenting with object
                                    detection pipelines or building context-aware agents, I’m learning how to harness
                                    these tools to solve meaningful problems. This hands-on approach directly supports
                                    my goal of developing next-generation applications that don’t just run—but
                                    understand, adapt, and respond intelligently.

                                <p class="skill-details">I built a custom
                                    language interpreter using the Lark parsing library, applying recursive tree
                                    structures, expression evaluation, and memory management—strengthening my ability to
                                    think algorithmically. I’ve also studied machine learning algorithms related to
                                    Gaussian filtering and computer vision as part of my AI coursework, deepening my
                                    understanding of how foundational algorithms drive intelligent systems. Beyond my
                                    own work, I’ve consistently helped classmates grasp recursion, linked lists, and
                                    dynamic programming, which has reinforced my own skills and sharpened my ability to
                                    break down complex topics—critical for collaborative development of AI-integrated
                                    applications.</p>

                                    developed strong technical communication and leadership skills by organizing
                                    workshops, leading team initiatives, and mentoring peers in STEM. I’m continually
                                    working to bridge the gap between complex technical concepts and accessible
                                    explanations—whether guiding students through algorithms or collaborating with
                                    fellow officers. These experiences have taught me how to lead with clarity, listen
                                    actively, and communicate technical ideas across diverse teams.</p>
